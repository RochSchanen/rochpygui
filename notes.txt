list of thoughts as they come...

- learn to build a package for all these modules

- check that bypassing _onEraseBackground() is necessary or worse: clumsy

base:

- add features to setup title, the startup position, etc...

Themes:

- Create a theme system: theme images and backgrounds that can be
easily updated or modified. DONE partially (06 April 2020).
- try to use the benefit of png transparency
- try to make use of the SVG language for the graphics
- it would be nice to split the geometry from the colors...
(this might be a lot more complicated than it seems)
- select images for switch, push, led, etc.. by simple names

layout:

- Make a library of tools that select, group and align in a similar
way that illustrator does. This would allow for a very versatile
system while remaining pretty much user friendly. There would be some
logic in the process of organising the graphics layout.
- find out about tabs

timer:

- try generate timer signals shifted from each other (if necessary)

gpib:

- how to resolve conflicting command from separated threads
(this is a big chunk of infos to gather)
- SR830 QUERRIES ARE SLOW: is it possible to fix the situation?
- check platform and adjust backend automatic selection

scripting:

- how to externally script and controled python programs using a TCP/IP interface.

display:

-

buttons:

- build a generic wheel input control
	leave the boundaries behaviour to the child class
	(base class to be used for building larger wheel input)
	fix the format definition to include spaces every 3 decades

controls:

- change self.evt to evt: only used once to bind event object

Config:

- Make a library to quickly and simply write and read to/from
a configuration file that can be edited or created manually in
a text file form: this is an important chunk.

Log/Data base:

- Make a log system. Accessible as a database.

Pdf:

 - Export graphs as pdf for sharing and printing
